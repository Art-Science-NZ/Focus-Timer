# Installation for Windows
1. To install please install requirements.txt
2. In the main.py file, edit the FOLDER_NAME variable to be the name of the directory in your Documents folder.
3. If the parent.parent is not Documents then edit that location as well.
4. Then you can run the command for 
    pyinstaller  --onefile main.py 
(I do this while in the parent directory of the repository)
3. Create a shortcut for your exe file
